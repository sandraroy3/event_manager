# Reflection on Learning

This project deepened my expertise in backend REST API development, testing, and debugging using FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and Docker. I gained advanced proficiency in request validation with Pydantic, asynchronous database operations using SQLAlchemy, and implementing JWT-based authentication. Additionally, I configured custom OpenAPI documentation to enhance Swagger UI usability, particularly for token-based workflows.

From a quality assurance perspective, I strengthened my skills in writing comprehensive automated tests with Pytest, documenting issues in GitHub, and validating application behavior through both manual and programmatic testing. I developed a stronger appreciation for edge case coverage, including enforcing unique email constraints and field-level validations. The project also improved my familiarity with DevOps practices, including Docker usage and Git workflows such as branching strategies, pull requests, and version control.

Overall, this assignment refined both my technical capabilities and my collaborative approach, equipping me to contribute effectively to real-world software development and QA teams.
